## Dot Files

I don't ever put anything in my .vimrc that I don't understand. This vim setup is always changing and getting to be a very comfortable setup for development.

###### To get started:

    $> git submodule init
    $> git submodule update
    $> cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
    $> ./install.sh (need to brew install cmake for this)
